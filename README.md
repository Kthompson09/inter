# type-single-page
 The project is a web site dedicated to showcasing a variable font and all of its shifting axes. The font i chose to work with was Inter as it felt the most interesting to me with it world wide usage and clean interface 
The website aims to showcase this with brief history and a look at the fonts shifting axes in live time 
I learned that variable fonts can be extremely dynamic and this can help improve many different aspects of design such as aesthetics , mood / theme and other perception of a design. I also learned quite a bit a skills in vscode such as different ways to wrap and organize specific elements of a web design layout 
My project stands out as every design choice made reflects the reason the font exists. So as inter is a web type that is widely recognized i made my sites color and theme aline with such themes.
To address accessibility i played with contrasting colors, alt text ( if needed ) and simple design choices 
I made my mock ups on illustrator and figma as i wanted to play with both graphic and layouts in different ways
